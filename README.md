# python-challenge
This repository contains two programs. These programs are PyBank and PyPoll.
PyBank reads a csv file with two columns, Date and Profit/Loss. 
The program within the file, main.py, reads the csv file and lists how many months are in the data, the total profit/loss over the course of the period recorded, the average change in profit/loss, the greatest increase in profit and the greatest decrease in profit.
It also lists the month and year for the greatest increase/decrease.
PyPoll takes a look at a different csv file with three columns housing election data.
These columns are Voter_ID, County and Candidate.
The program main.py will show the total amount of votes, list the names of the candidates along with the perctage of the votes they got and the actual number of votes they got. 
Finally, the program will show who won the election.
Both programs not only display their analysis in the terminal but also write the analysis into a text file and put it in a seperate analysis folder.
